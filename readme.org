* Bacure

A clojure library wrapping the excellent BACnet4J library. Hopefully
it will be able to abstract some of the ugly BACnet details
(datatypes) and provide a seamless Clojure experience.

Its main goal is to replace to awful hack that is [[https://github.com/Frozenlock/Bacnet-scan-utils][Bacnet-scan-utils]].
